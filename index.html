        <h2>Population Overview since 1980</h2>
        <p>Since 1901, Australia's population has substantially increased both nationally and at the state and
            territory level.Australia’s 2021 population is 6.8 times larger than in 1901, increasing from 3.8 to 25.7
            million.The national population has grown every year, excluding WWI, since 1901.The highest net population
            growth occurred in 2023.

        </p>

        <h2>Focusing on Population Trends from 2013 to 2023</h2>
        <p><strong>Net overseas migration</strong> has been a significant driver of Australia's population
            growth, accounting for
            over half of the total increase throughout the period observed. The numbers rose dramatically from a
            net inflow of 30,000 individuals in 1992–93 to 241,000 in 2018–19. However, the COVID-19 pandemic
            brought unprecedented changes with international border closures leading to the first net outflow
            since World War II, recording a decrease of 85,000 in 2020–21. Concurrently, <strong>natural
                increase</strong> (births
            minus deaths) contributed nearly half of the demographic growth, although it has seen a decline—from
            139,000 individuals in 1992–93 to 106,000 in 2022–23. This shift reflects the decreasing fertility
            rates, down from 1.86 to 1.58 babies per woman over the same timeframe, and an ageing population, as
            the number of deaths has begun to surpass the number of births.

        <h2>Detailed State Analysis</h2>
        <p>Australia’s capital cities tend to be younger and age more slowly than regional areas.
            This is mainly because capital cities have historically attracted a larger share of overseas
            migrants,
            who tend to be younger than the overall population.
        </p>
        <div class="dashboard-part">
            <div id="vis2" class="visualization"></div>


        </div>
        <p>Since its federation, Australia has experienced significant aging across its population, marked by a
            gradual increase in the median age from 22.5 years in 1901 to 38.4 years in 2023. Notably, females
            have consistently outnumbered males since 1978,
            reflecting broader demographic trends.<br>Over the years, the 5-9 years age group has seen the
            largest
            decrease as a proportion of the total population, while the 60-64 age group has witnessed the most
            substantial increase. </p>

            <div id="vis5" class="visualization"></div>
        </div>
        <p><strong>Net overseas migration</strong> has been a significant factor in Australia's population
            growth, particularly
            before the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the pandemic led to the first net outflow of -85,000 in
            2020-21 due to border restrictions. As restrictions eased,
            migration rebounded to 204,000 in 2021-22 and surged to 528,000 by 2022-23.<br><strong>Natural
                increase</strong>
            has also played a role, although its impact has diminished relative to total
            population growth. Fertility rates have dropped from 1.86 in 1992-93 to 1.58 in 2022-23, with life
            expectancy increasing.
            <br><strong>Internal migration</strong> has historically been high in Australia but saw
            significant
            reductions during the
            pandemic. Movement between states fell sharply in 2020, only partially recovering by 2022.
